### Interactive

The TUI mode of the ChatGPT tool can be accessed by running the **`chatgptui`** command without any additional flags. Upon executing the command, you will be prompted to provide the necessary configuration inputs that are required to use the language model.

The configuration inputs may include parameters such as the OpenAI API key, model, maximum length of the generated text, etc. These settings can be adjusted to tailor the output generated by the model according to your requirements.

Once you have provided the required configuration inputs, the system will direct you to the chat view model. Here, you can start generating responses by entering your prompts into the interface. The chat view model displays the conversation history, making it easier to keep track of the ongoing conversation.

#### Shortcuts

These shortcuts allow you to perform various actions quickly, and make it easier to use the tool and interact with the language model.

* `ctrl+c`/`esc`: Use these keyboard combinations to quit the ChatGPTUI.
* `tab`: Use this key to fill in the default value for a field in the configuration view model.

In addition to those shortcuts, ChatGPTUI also provides a convenient way to clear the chat history. Simply type `/clear` or `/c` in the text area of the chat view model to clear the chat history and start a new conversation.

Those keyboard shortcuts can help you streamline your workflow & increase your productivity, and save your time & make the ChatGPTUI tool more convenient to use. They allow you to navigate through the available options quickly, fill in default values easily, and clear the chat history with just a few keystrokes, improving your overall experience with the tool!
